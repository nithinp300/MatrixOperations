# matrixOperations
An application to do matrix adding, subtracting, negating, scalar multiplication, multiplication, inverse, and transpose.<br /><br />
I implemented a dynamic programming algorithm that appropriately orders the matrix multiplication so that the cost of multiplying all the matrices together is as low as possible. Also, I implemented memoization by using an array to store values that have already been computed to make the algorithm more efficient.
